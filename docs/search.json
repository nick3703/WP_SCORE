Every year, teams in the NBA assign contracts to players based on their previous performance. It’s important for NBA teams, who hire data scientists, to strike a balance between properly compensating players for their skill and also reserving money and staying under budget. However, learners should have an upfront understanding of the limitations of our model: it does not account for rookie players, and only applies to players who are no longer on rookie contracts. We wanted to keep this as simple as possible for those trying to understand Ordinal Logistic Regression.",

    "text": "Sports Application\nEach year, the NBA as a whole makes upwards of $10.58 billion in revenue. WOW! Have you ever wondered where all of this money goes or how teams determine how much money each player gets paid? Believe it or not, the allocation of this funding based on the relevant skills and talents of the players is important for nurturing player development while ensuring the NBA’s competitive balance. Over time, in order to have a good team and thus make more money, owners and general managers must compensate their players adequately so that they do not join other teams. However, teams must have enough money for self-sustainment and funding events. As such, the unique balance arises whereby teams must pay players just enough to satisfy them while ensuring that the team makes a profit off of their games and events.\nAs a preliminary measure of finding the best salary to pay players based on previous skill, we aim to determine which factors can predict the bin of an NBA salary. As such, this bin will have three levels: low, medium, and high. We feel that this model is a precursor to someone understanding how NBA teams ensure efficiency of monetary allocation and thus team financial success.",

    "text": "Statistical Technique\nOrdinal Logistic Regression is a form of Logistic Regression in which one can model a relationship between an ordinal response variable (NBA salary bin: low, medium, high) and one or more explanatory variables (player statistics, performance, and more).\n\nWhat about Logistic Regression?\nIt’s important to also understand before we get started that logistic regression essentially estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as whether someone does something or not. In contrast to linear regression, logistic regression has a binary (or more than two binned) response variable.\n\n\nWhy Ordinal Regression Here?\nThe difference between Ordinal and Logistic Regression is that in ordinal, the response variable has a specific order. For example, in this case, the “order” is “low, medium, and high” salary. Another example of this might be survey responses: for example, “bad, alright, awesome” which need to be in the correct order and are also not numerically spaced. One final example would be predicting the stages of a disease. For example, in trying to predict the stages of cancer based on previous patient data, order of predictions would matter because such order informs the level of metastasis of the cancer. As you can probably tell, Ordinal Logistic regression is more complex than normal logistic regression due to the nature of having multiple categories and thus thresholds.",

The data is linked at the following cite which also has an explanation of what the variables in the data mean and various ways to analyze it. See below:\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-nba-salaries-with-machine-learning-ed68b6f75566\nThe data on NBA players contains information on various measurables in professional basketball from the 2021-2022 NBA regular season. It contains 812 player-team stints for the season, meaning that there are 812 individual observations. Were a player to have played for multiple teams in the given season, they are recorded as unique observations. This is an advantage for ordinal logistic regression because we are looking to see the factors that determine the bin of a player’s salary. It is worth noting that this dataset is already “cleaned” in the sense that there are no missing, or NA, values. However, for your awareness, it is worth noting that NBA data is collected by Second Spectrum softward which tracks the movements of each player on the court and the basketball 25 times per second!

However, we are confident that the data is clean enough initially and well-organized. From the initial exploration, notice that the distributions for some variables, salary included, had been scaled down already. Another potential drawback is that we will be unable to create a model that considers years in the league or whether the player was on a rookie contract. This information simply isn’t in the data. Still, we can get a solid picture of the predictions due to the binning and we find that our model is relatively accurate in predicting player salary even despite these limitations.",

    "text": "EXERCISE 2\nWe realize that we need to account for position. We need to do this because player position is a likely confounding variable that affects performance as players on the court have distinct responsibilities. Thus, we can also see how the position of the player influences salary bin.\nIn the chunk below, transform the Position column so that each position is now represented numerically (1 through 5, associated with the proper position: 1 is PG, 2 is SG, 3 is SF, 4 is PF, and 5 is C). Pay close attention to how the data is currently represented. A proper implementation will have a single variable called “Position”.\n\n# Your Code Here\n\n#assigns positional values for each position. Specifically,\n#1 for Point Guard, 2 for Shooting Guard, 3 for small\n#forward, 4 for power forward, and 5 for center.\nbball_clean$Position &lt;- case_when(\n  bball_clean$PG == 1 ~ 1,\n  bball_clean$SG == 1 ~ 2,\n  bball_clean$SF == 1 ~ 3,\n  bball_clean$PF == 1 ~ 4,\n  bball_clean$C == 1 ~ 5,\n  TRUE ~ 0\n)\n\nWhich position in basketball (PG, SG, SF, PF, or C) do you think gets paid the most? Why?\n\nPut solution here\nWe must now filter the Basketball Clean data frame so that it only includes players who are 25 and older. This is important because the rookie salary is calibrated differently and most rookies are under the age of 25.\nKeep in mind that filtering for ages greater than 25 decreases the number of observations in the data set. Before you do this, you need to make sure you still have enough data to create a good model.\n\nbball_clean &lt;- bball_clean %&gt;% \n  filter(Age &gt;= 25)\n\nprint(nrow(bball_clean))\n\n[1] 675\n\n\nBased on our intuition, 675 is still enough observations to conduct a sound analysis. However, to determine the lowest number of observations one can have in a dataset and still conduct ordinal logistic regression would depend on a power analysis. While power analysis is outside of the scope of this module, it is essentially a minimum sample size requirement test based on the desired level of statistical power that one seeks in conducting their statistical model. We thus conclude that 675 is enough data to create a good Ordinal Logistic Regression model.\nLet’s check our work and now visualize the data!",

    "section": "Assumptions",
    "text": "Assumptions\nThere are several key assumptions in Ordinal Logistic Regression. The first is the proportional odds assumption, which states that the relationship between each pair of outcome categories is consistent across all levels of the independent variables. Put more simply, the odds of being in a higher category versus a lower category must be constant across different levels of the independent variables. For example, this assumption would be violated if most players had a lower salary (which we see is somewhat true but does not make a major impact on our analysis here). Second, our observations must be independent of one another. This could potentially be violated as someone’s team might have more money and certain groups of players (think teams) could potentially be clustered and dependent on one another. To combat this in a more advanced module, one might look into conducting clustered ordinal logistic regression to account for this potentially dependent structure of the data. Next, linearity of logit. OLR assumes that the relationship between independent variables and the log odds of the outcome categories is linear.",

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nThere are a few limitations of OLR worth mentioning.Firstly, it can be hard to interpret the coefficients from our model. For example, understanding how each predictor influences salary categories can be challenging. Thus, analysts or even team managers might not be able to use this model to make acionable decisions and should thus stick to other methods. Our model also assumes a linear relationship between predictors (player stats) and salary categories. However, this is not always a linear relationship which can thus lead to predictions of the model not being as accurate. Also, given the nature of the multiple categories we are trying to predict, OLR needs a lot of data to make accurate guesses about how player statistics relate to salaries. Thus, OLR models can only be used on larger datasets like the one we have here, which may not always be available. Finally, we acknowledge that our independence assumption is likely violated as different teams have less (or more) money to pay their players. Thus, the dependency among players within the same team violates the independence assumption and could impact our model’s estimates. One option for solving this is conducting clustered Ordinal Logistic Regression, which thus accounts for the dependence of observations between clusters (teams here). This extends beyond the scope of our module but is worthy of investigation.",

Each coefficient seen from the summary is the effect size on the log odds of being in a higher salary category. For instance, the Age coefficient of 0.160 suggests that for players older than 25, as the age of the player increases by one year, the log odds of being in a higher salary category increases by .16, holding all other variables constant.\nIn OLR, the intercepts are where we divide the categories. Their associated values indicate the log odds of being in or above the category when all predictors are zero. The AIC, or Akaike Information Criterion, is used for determining how well a model fits the data from which it was generated. In other words, the AIC helps answer the question of whether the OLR model make sense for the basketball data, and does it work for the bins into which we’ve separated player salaries?\nWe will now calculate p-values for each coefficient in the ordinal logistic regression model which will allow us another metric for understanding statistical significance.

    "text": "Wrap Up and Future Directions\nTo expand on this skill and apply OLR in other areas, you might do the following:\n\nFurther Model evaluation\nTo further evaluate the model, you might look into ROC curves or precision-recall curves, thus giving us a more nuanced understanding of our model’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nFuture Analysis in Other Areas\nSince we’re interested in applying this in sports, you might want to look into gaining an edge by applying OLR to your fantasy sports league to forecast player performance. This could help you to identify undervalued players and inform strategic decisions such as making trades and picking up free agents. OLR would specifically be used in creating player ranking systems, player valuation systems, and even binning the value of players in terms of season long term projections. To best illustrate how this approach could be used in another elementary (non sports) situation, consider the question, “What fast food order at McDonalds is most likely to result in the customer ordering a”small”, “medium,” or “large” drink? We could thus collect data on different types of McDonalds orders and have our dependent variable be the “bin” of the type of drink ordered. Going back to sports, we could also use Ordinal Logistic Regression to answer the question, “What offensive line configurations are more likely to result in more running yards? Thus, we could bin certain amounts of”yards gained” or places on the field that the play gets to (for example: 20,40,60) as the dependent variable whereas the independent variable includes various offensive line configurations.\n\n\nRelated Concepts and Skills\nIf one is looking to learn related concepts and skills, we would recommend investigating the following types of modules shown below:\n\nMachine Learning Algorithms\nThis includes using decision trees, random forests, vector machines, and even neural networks which can allow for creating more flexible models than in Ordinal Logistic Regression. This would be best especially for optimizing one’s fantasy sports league.\n\n\nLinear Regression\nHere, we dealt with binned data. If someone wanted to try and predict a numerical response variable, we recommend starting with learning Linear Regression if it is not already understood.\nThanks for tuning in!",
